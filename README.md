###Synopsis
Relevnt provides the user visibility to topics trending on Twitter and the news at that moment. By using various APIs,trending topics and top news articles are now in one place for the user to view. Results are also cached frequently so previously trending news and tweets are accessible. With the intuitive layout, the user is able to decipher the disconnect between trending tweets versus whatâ€™s going on in the news. 

###Motivation
I realized that a lot of what's being talked about is not what's happening that matters, so through this project I figured I'd learn more about what's relevent today.
